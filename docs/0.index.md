WPNuxt is a Nuxt module that integrates WordPress with Nuxt 4 via GraphQL (WPGraphQL). It provides type-safe composables and utilities for fetching WordPress content with automatic code generation.

## Key Features

- **Type-Safe GraphQL Integration** - Automatic TypeScript types from your WordPress schema
- **Auto-Generated Composables** - Both sync and async variants for each query
- **Server-Side Caching** - Built-in Nitro caching with stale-while-revalidate support
- **Extensible Queries** - Easily extend or override default GraphQL queries
- **Modern Architecture** - Built for Nuxt 4 with clean separation of concerns

## Architecture

WPNuxt delegates GraphQL operations to [nuxt-graphql-middleware](https://nuxt-graphql-middleware.dulnan.net/) and adds:

1. **Query Management** - Merges default queries with your custom queries
2. **Composable Generation** - Creates type-safe `use{QueryName}()` functions
3. **Performance Optimization** - Nitro route rules for server-side caching
4. **WordPress Integration** - Image path utilities and content transformations

## Comparison with @wpnuxt/core

**wpnuxt** is a cleaner, more modular implementation focused on:

- Core GraphQL integration
- Modern async patterns
- Better TypeScript support
- Simpler architecture with better separation of concerns

**@wpnuxt/core** is a more feature-rich solution with:

- Built-in authentication support
- Staging mode
- Content renderer components
- Custom LRU caching implementation
