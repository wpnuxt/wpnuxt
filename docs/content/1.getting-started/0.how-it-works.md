title: How WPNuxt Works
description: Understand the architecture behind WPNuxt
---

WPNuxt connects three layers: **WordPress** stores your content, **GraphQL** exposes it as structured data, and **Nuxt** renders it as a fast, modern website. This page explains how the pieces fit together.

## The Mental Model

```
WordPress (CMS) → WPGraphQL (API) → WPNuxt (bridge) → Nuxt (frontend)
```

- **WordPress** is your content management system — editors create posts, pages, and menus here
- **WPGraphQL** is a WordPress plugin that exposes content through a GraphQL API
- **WPNuxt** is a Nuxt module that generates type-safe composables from GraphQL queries
- **Nuxt** renders the content as server-rendered (or static) pages with Vue components

## Request Flow

When a visitor opens a page on your site, here's what happens:

```
Browser
  → Nuxt route (e.g. /blog/my-post)
    → composable (e.g. useNodeByUri)
      → GraphQL middleware (Nitro server)
        → Server cache check
          → HIT:  return cached response (~1-5ms)
          → MISS: fetch from WordPress GraphQL API (~200-500ms)
            → cache response, return to browser
```

On the **first request**, WPNuxt fetches data from WordPress via GraphQL. On subsequent requests, the server cache returns the response instantly. With SWR (stale-while-revalidate) enabled, visitors always get a fast response while fresh data is fetched in the background.

## The Three Packages

| Package | What It Does | When You Need It |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| `@wpnuxt/core` | GraphQL integration, auto-generated composables, caching | **Always** — this is the foundation |
| `@wpnuxt/blocks` | Renders Gutenberg blocks as Vue components | When you want per-block control (custom styling, lazy images, interactive blocks) |
| `@wpnuxt/auth` | WordPress authentication (password, OAuth) | When editors need to log in through your Nuxt frontend (e.g. preview mode, gated content) |

Most projects start with `@wpnuxt/core` alone. Add `@wpnuxt/blocks` when you need fine-grained control over how WordPress blocks render. Add `@wpnuxt/auth` when you need authentication.

## How Composables Are Generated

WPNuxt's key feature is **auto-generated composables**. Here's the build-time pipeline that makes this work:

```
1. GraphQL files (.gql)
   ├── Default queries (src/runtime/queries/)     ← ships with WPNuxt
   └── Your custom queries (extend/queries/)       ← you create these

2. Query merging
   └── Both sets are copied to .queries/ folder
       (your files override defaults with the same name)

3. Parsing
   └── Each query is parsed to extract name, variables, and return type

4. Code generation
   └── For each query "Foo", WPNuxt generates:
       ├── useFoo()        — blocks navigation until data is ready (good for SEO)
       └── useAsyncFoo()   — loads in the background (good for secondary content)

5. Output
   ├── .nuxt/wpnuxt/index.mjs   — composable implementations
   └── .nuxt/wpnuxt/index.d.ts  — TypeScript declarations
```

This is why `pnpm nuxt prepare` is needed after adding or changing `.gql` files — it triggers the pipeline that generates your composables and their types.

You never import composables manually. Nuxt auto-imports them, so `usePosts()` is available in any component without an import statement.

## Caching Layers

WPNuxt uses three layers of caching, all enabled by default:

```
Layer 1: Client cache (per browser)
  └── Deduplicates identical GraphQL queries during navigation
      (e.g. navigating back to a page you already visited)

Layer 2: Server cache (Nitro, shared across all users)
  └── Caches GraphQL responses server-side
      First request: ~200-500ms (fetches from WordPress)
      Cached request: ~1-5ms

Layer 3: Payload cache (per request)
  └── Prevents refetch during SSR → client hydration
      (the data fetched on the server is reused on the client)
```

For most sites, the defaults work well. See [Caching](/guide/caching) for how to tune cache duration, disable caching for specific queries, or handle cache invalidation.
