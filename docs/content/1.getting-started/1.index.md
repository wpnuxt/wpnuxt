---

WPNuxt connects WordPress to Nuxt 4 via GraphQL, giving you type-safe composables for fetching content.

::callout{type="success" icon="i-heroicons-sparkles"}
**WPNuxt v2** (currently in alpha) is a complete rewrite for Nuxt 4, with a simplified API, better TypeScript support, and new features like server-side caching and AI tooling. [See what's new →](#whats-new-in-v2)

## Why WPNuxt?

- **Type-safe** - Auto-generated TypeScript types from your WordPress schema
- **Simple API** - `usePosts()`, `usePages()`, `useMenu()` - just works
- **Extensible** - Add custom queries, get custom composables

## Packages

| Package | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `@wpnuxt/core` | GraphQL integration, composables | Alpha |
| `@wpnuxt/blocks` | Render Gutenberg blocks as Vue components | Alpha |
| `@wpnuxt/auth` | WordPress authentication (password, OAuth) | Alpha |
| `wpnuxi` | CLI for scaffolding and diagnostics | Alpha |

::callout{type="info"}
WPNuxt v2 is currently in **alpha**. APIs may change before the stable release. Check the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/wpnuxt/wpnuxt/releases) for the latest version and changelog.
::

## Quick Look

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data: posts } = await usePosts()
</script>

<template>
  <article v-for="post in posts" :key="post.id">
    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    <div v-sanitize-html="post.excerpt" />
  </article>
</template>
```

That's it. No GraphQL queries to write, no types to define.

## What's New in v2

WPNuxt v2 is a **complete rewrite** built for Nuxt 4:
