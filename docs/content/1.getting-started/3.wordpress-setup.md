# WordPress Setup

## Required Plugin

Install and activate [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/).

## Recommended Settings

In **WordPress Admin → GraphQL → Settings**:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| GraphQL Endpoint | `/graphql` | Default, matches WPNuxt config |
| Enable Introspection | Yes | Required for schema download |
| Public Introspection | Yes | For development |

::callout{type="warning"}
Disable **Public Introspection** in production if your schema contains sensitive information.
::

## For @wpnuxt/blocks

To render Gutenberg blocks, also install:

- [WPGraphQL Content Blocks](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks)

This exposes block data in the GraphQL schema.

## Test Your Setup

Visit `https://your-site.com/graphql` in a browser. You should see a GraphQL IDE.

Try this query:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    nodes {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

If you see your posts, WordPress is ready.
