Follow these steps to prepare your WordPress site for WPNuxt.

## Step 1: Install WPGraphQL (Required)

WordPress doesn't expose a GraphQL API by default. WPGraphQL adds one, which WPNuxt uses to fetch your content with type safety and auto-generated composables.

1. In WordPress Admin, go to **Plugins → Add New**
2. Search for **WPGraphQL** or [download it here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
3. Click **Install Now**, then **Activate**

## Step 2: Configure WPGraphQL Settings

In **WordPress Admin → GraphQL → Settings**, configure:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| GraphQL Endpoint | `/graphql` | Default, matches WPNuxt config |
| Enable Introspection | Yes | Required for schema download |
| Public Introspection | Yes | Needed for development |

::callout{type="warning"}
Disable **Public Introspection** in production if your schema contains sensitive information.
::

## Step 3: Install WPGraphQL Content Blocks (Optional)

The standard GraphQL API returns post content as a single HTML string. This plugin exposes individual Gutenberg blocks as structured data, so `@wpnuxt/blocks` can render each block with its own Vue component.

**Required only if you use `@wpnuxt/blocks`** to render Gutenberg blocks as Vue components.

1. Download from [WPGraphQL Content Blocks](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks/releases)
2. In WordPress Admin, go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
3. Upload the zip file and click **Activate**

This exposes block data in the GraphQL schema so `@wpnuxt/blocks` can render them.

## Step 4: Install Headless Login for WPGraphQL (Optional)

WordPress authentication uses cookies tied to the WordPress domain. This plugin adds JWT-based authentication to WPGraphQL, enabling login flows from your Nuxt frontend.

**Required only if you use `@wpnuxt/auth`** for WordPress authentication.

1. Download from [Headless Login for WPGraphQL](https://github.com/AxeWP/wp-graphql-headless-login/releases)
2. In WordPress Admin, go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
3. Upload the zip file and click **Activate**

After installation, configure providers in **WordPress Admin → GraphQL → Headless Login**:

1. Enable the **Password** provider for username/password authentication
2. Optionally configure OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) for social login

See the [Authentication Guide](/auth) for detailed setup instructions.

## Verify Your Setup

Visit `https://your-site.com/graphql` in a browser. You should see the GraphQL IDE.

Try this query:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    nodes {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

If you see your posts, WordPress is ready. Continue to [Installation](/getting-started/installation).
