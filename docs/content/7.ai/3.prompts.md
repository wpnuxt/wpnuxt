## switch-wordpress

Use this prompt when you need to:
- Switch to a different WordPress site
- Check which site you're currently connected to
- Troubleshoot connection issues

**Input:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `newWordpressUrl` | string | No | New WordPress URL (leave empty to check status) |

**Example: Checking connection status**

> **You:** Use the switch-wordpress prompt (without URL)

> **AI:** You're currently connected to:
> - **Site:** WordPress WPNuxt Demo
> - **URL:** https://wordpress.wpnuxt.com
> - **Connected since:** 5 minutes ago
>
> Would you like to continue with this site or switch to a different one?

**Example: Switching sites**

>

## Chaining Prompts

You can chain prompts together for a complete workflow. Here's an example:

1. **Connect** to your WordPress site:
   > Use connect-wordpress with https://my-site.com

2. **Explore** the content structure, then ask the AI to generate a project:
   > Generate a WPNuxt project based on this site

3. **Switch** to a staging site to test:
   > Use switch-wordpress with https://staging.my-site.com

4. **Compare** content between the two sites:
   > How does this site's content differ from the previous one?

The AI maintains context across the conversation, so it can compare content structures, suggest changes, and generate code that works with both environments.

## Using Prompts

### In Claude Desktop

Click the prompt button (📎) and select a WPNuxt prompt from the list.

### In Claude Code

Prompts are available through the MCP integration. Simply describe what you want to do:

```
Connect me to my WordPress site at https://example.com
```

The AI will automatically use the appropriate prompt and tools.

### In Custom MCP Clients

Request a prompt programmatically:

```javascript
const response = await client.getPrompt('connect-wordpress', {
  wordpressUrl: 'https://example.com'
})
```

## Troubleshooting

### "WordPress site not found" after connecting

The MCP server validates the URL by checking for a WPGraphQL endpoint. Make sure:
- The URL is correct (no trailing slash needed)
- WPGraphQL is installed and activated
- The GraphQL endpoint is accessible (try visiting `https://your-site.com/graphql` in a browser)

### Prompts not showing up in Claude Desktop

1. Verify your MCP configuration in Claude Desktop settings
2. Check that the WPNuxt MCP server URL is reachable: `https://wpnuxt.com/mcp`
3. Restart Claude Desktop after changing the configuration

### "No content types found"

This usually means WPGraphQL is installed but no content is published. Verify:
- You have at least one published post or page
- Your WordPress user has read permissions
- Custom post types are registered with `show_in_graphql: true`
