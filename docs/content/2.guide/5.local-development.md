description: Set up a local WordPress environment for your WPNuxt project
---

To develop your WPNuxt project locally, you need a WordPress installation with WPGraphQL. Here are your options.

## Quick Comparison

| Option | Best For | Requires Docker? | Setup Time |
|--------|----------|------------------|------------|
| [WordPress Playground](#option-1-wordpress-playground-recommended) | Quick start, no installation needed | No | ~1 min |
| [LocalWP](#option-2-localwp) | Persistent local environment with GUI | No | ~5 min |
| [wp-env](#option-3-wp-env-docker) | CI/CD, reproducible environments | Yes | ~10 min |
| [Existing WordPress](#option-4-existing-wordpress) | Teams with a staging site already running | No | ~2 min |
| [Demo instance](#demo-wordpress) | Quick exploration, no WordPress needed | No | 0 min |

## Option 1: WordPress Playground (Recommended)

The WPNuxt starter template includes a [WordPress Playground](https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/) blueprint that launches a fully configured WordPress instance in your browser — no server, no Docker, no installation.

### Setup

1. Create a project with the starter template (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm create wpnuxt@latest
   ```

2. Start the dev server with WordPress Playground:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev:blueprint
   ```

This starts a WordPress Playground with WPGraphQL, sample content (posts, pages, menus, images), and pretty permalinks — then launches the Nuxt dev server pointed at it.

### What's Included

The blueprint configures WordPress with:
- WPGraphQL plugin (activated)
- Pretty permalinks (`/%postname%/`)
- Sample blog posts, pages, and a navigation menu
- Public introspection enabled

### Limitations

- Data is **ephemeral** — it resets when you stop the server
- Not suitable for testing WordPress plugins or custom themes
- Runs in Node.js, not a full PHP/MySQL environment

::callout{type="tip"}
WordPress Playground is ideal for development and testing. For persistent content, use LocalWP or an existing WordPress installation.

## Option 2: LocalWP

[LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) is a free, user-friendly app for running WordPress locally.

### Setup

1. Download and install [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/)
2. Click **Create a new site**
3. Choose a site name (e.g., "my-wpnuxt-site")
4. Use the default PHP/MySQL settings
5. Set your admin credentials

### Install Required Plugins

In your LocalWP site's WordPress admin:

1. Go to **Plugins → Add New**
2. Search for and install **WPGraphQL**
3. Activate the plugin

For Gutenberg blocks support, also install:
- [WPGraphQL Content Blocks](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks) (download from GitHub)

For authentication (`@wpnuxt/auth`):
- [Headless Login for WPGraphQL](https://github.com/AxeWP/wp-graphql-headless-login) (download from GitHub)

### Connect to Nuxt

Find your site URL in LocalWP (e.g., `http://my-wpnuxt-site.local`) and add it to your `.env`:

```bash [.env]
WPNUXT_WORDPRESS_URL=http://my-wpnuxt-site.local
```

## Option 3: wp-env (Docker)

[wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) is WordPress's official Docker-based local environment.

### Requirements

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Node.js 20+

### Setup

1. Install wp-env globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @wordpress/env
   ```

2. Create `.wp-env.json` in your project root:
   ```json
   {
     "plugins": [
       "https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-graphql.zip",
       "https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks/releases/latest/download/wp-graphql-content-blocks.zip"
     ],
     "port": 8080
   }
   ```

3. Start WordPress:
   ```bash
   wp-env start
   ```

4. Access WordPress admin at `http://localhost:8080/wp-admin`
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `password`

5. Add to your `.env`:
   ```bash
   WPNUXT_WORDPRESS_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

### wp-env Commands

```bash
wp-env start      # Start WordPress
wp-env stop       # Stop WordPress
wp-env destroy    # Remove environment (start fresh)
```

## Option 4: Existing WordPress

You can also use any existing WordPress installation (local or remote).

### Requirements

1. Install and activate [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
2. Enable introspection in **GraphQL → Settings**
3. Ensure the GraphQL endpoint is accessible from your dev machine

### Connect

```bash [.env]
WPNUXT_WORDPRESS_URL=https://your-wordpress-site.com
```

::callout{type="tip"}
For remote development, consider using a staging site rather than production.
::

## Testing Your Setup

After configuring WordPress, verify it works:

1. Visit `{your-wordpress-url}/graphql` - you should see the GraphQL IDE
2. Run this query:
   ```graphql
   {
     posts {
       nodes {
         title
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Start your Nuxt dev server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Demo WordPress

Don't have WordPress set up yet? Use our demo instance to get started:

```bash [.env]
WPNUXT_WORDPRESS_URL=https://wordpress.wpnuxt.com
```

This is a read-only demo with sample content, perfect for trying out WPNuxt.
