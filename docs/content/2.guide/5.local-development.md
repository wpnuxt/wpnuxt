---

To develop your WPNuxt project locally, you need a WordPress installation with WPGraphQL. Here are your options.

## Quick Comparison

| Option | Best For | Requires Docker? | Setup Time |
|--------|----------|------------------|------------|
| [LocalWP](#option-1-localwp-recommended) | Most developers — easy GUI, no Docker | No | ~5 min |
| [wp-env](#option-2-wp-env-docker) | CI/CD, reproducible environments | Yes | ~10 min |
| [Existing WordPress](#option-3-existing-wordpress) | Teams with a staging site already running | No | ~2 min |
| [Demo instance](#demo-wordpress) | Quick exploration, no WordPress needed | No | 0 min |

## Option 1: LocalWP (Recommended)

[LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) is a free, user-friendly app for running WordPress locally.

### Setup

1. Download and install [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/)
2. Click **Create a new site**
3. Choose a site name (e.g., "my-wpnuxt-site")
4. Use the default PHP/MySQL settings
5. Set your admin credentials

### Install Required Plugins

In your LocalWP site's WordPress admin:

1. Go to **Plugins → Add New**
2. Search for and install **WPGraphQL**
3. Activate the plugin

For Gutenberg blocks support, also install:
- [WPGraphQL Content Blocks](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks) (download from GitHub)

For authentication (`@wpnuxt/auth`):
- [Headless Login for WPGraphQL](https://github.com/AxeWP/wp-graphql-headless-login) (download from GitHub)

### Connect to Nuxt

Find your site URL in LocalWP (e.g., `http://my-wpnuxt-site.local`) and add it to your `.env`:

```bash [.env]
WPNUXT_WORDPRESS_URL=http://my-wpnuxt-site.local
```

## Option 2: wp-env (Docker)

[wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) is WordPress's official Docker-based local environment.

### Requirements

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Node.js 20+

### Setup

1. Install wp-env globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @wordpress/env
   ```

2. Create `.wp-env.json` in your project root:
   ```json
   {
     "plugins": [
       "https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-graphql.zip",
       "https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks/releases/latest/download/wp-graphql-content-blocks.zip"
     ],
     "port": 8080
   }
   ```

3. Start WordPress:
   ```bash
   wp-env start
   ```

4. Access WordPress admin at `http://localhost:8080/wp-admin`
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `password`

5. Add to your `.env`:
   ```bash
   WPNUXT_WORDPRESS_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

### wp-env Commands

```bash
wp-env start      # Start WordPress
wp-env stop       # Stop WordPress
wp-env destroy    # Remove environment (start fresh)
```

## Option 3: Existing WordPress

You can also use any existing WordPress installation (local or remote).

### Requirements

1. Install and activate [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
2. Enable introspection in **GraphQL → Settings**
3. Ensure the GraphQL endpoint is accessible from your dev machine

### Connect

```bash [.env]
WPNUXT_WORDPRESS_URL=https://your-wordpress-site.com
```

For remote development, consider using a staging site rather than production.

## Testing Your Setup

After configuring WordPress, verify it works:

1. Visit `{your-wordpress-url}/graphql` - you should see the GraphQL IDE
2. Run this query:
   ```graphql
   {
     posts {
       nodes {
         title
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Start your Nuxt dev server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Demo WordPress
